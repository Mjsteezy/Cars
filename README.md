My first project involving machine learning. The goal is to predict the sell price of a vehicle based on age, present price, kilometers driven, feul type, dealer or individual, and automatic or manual. 

I trained a randomforrestregressor model to make predicitons. I have provide notes on the different steps taken to build and train the model. 

I followed a guide on youtube by Krish Naik so i can get my first experience in training a actual model. I learned many skills in this project and very happy with the knowledge coming out from it.
